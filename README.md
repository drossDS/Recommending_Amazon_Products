# Recommending Amazon Products

Using Recommendation System Techniques to Make Better Recommendations

# Background and Problem Statement
This relatively short weekly project was part of the recommendation systems module in the MIT Applied Data Science Program (MIT ADSP).  Data for over 7.8 million Amazon product reviews was provided and included the user ID, Product ID, and rating information.  The task was to create a model which would recommend products to users using different recmmendation techniques.




# Note on MIT ADSP Weekly Projects:
Due ot the relatively brief nature of program at only 12 weeks in duration, the code for this project was provided to the students in a near-finished state.  It was responsibility of the student ot then go through and fill in the sections of code relevant to the specific methods covered during the week's lesson.  As this course was designed for individuals from all professional backgrounds working full-time jobs, there was an emphasis on developing the student's intuition for how to use data science tools, and less on the details behind coding an entier project from scratch.
